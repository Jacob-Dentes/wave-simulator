# wave-simulator

This is a simple program made in Unity to visualize waves and wave interference. Go to https://jacob-dentes.github.io/wave-simulator/ to use the program.

Hold right click or left shift and move your mouse to rotate the camera around the center.

Scroll the mousewheel to zoom in or out.

Click anywhere to create a wave. The wave will be created based on where you clicked on the Y=0 plane (where the particles started).

Press space or click the pause/play button to start and stop the program. You can still place waves while the game is paused but they will not move.

Use the sliders on the left to change the wave's properties (this will only change new waves, not existing waves).

  Amplitude will influence the amplitude of the wave in units.
  
  Period will influence the period of the wave (in seconds).
  
  Speed will influence the speed of the wave (in units per second).
  
  Resistance will influence how fast the wave dissipates as it travels from the center (in units of amplitude per second).
  
  Life time will influence how long the wave will last (in seconds). Pulling the slider all the way to the right will make it last indefinitely.
  
Press the "r" key or the generate button to create a fresh plane and end all current waves

Use the sliders on the right to change the plane (this will only change the plane when a fresh plane is created, it will not change the current plane).

  Rows will determine the number of rows of particles.
  
  Columns will determine the number of columns of particles.
  
  Spacing will change the distance between each particle.
  
  *Note that the number of particles is the primary factor determining the performance of the program, and there may be framerate issues with larger numbers of particles*
  
Thank you for your interest in my project!
